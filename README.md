## About
dbHive offers an interactive dashboard that visualizes the performance of one or more PostgreSQL databases. By providing easily accessible information about the health and activity of a database, dbHive enables developers to make informed decisions that optimize the way they store their data.

## Getting Started
1. **Fork** and **clone** this [repository](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/dbhive) to your machine.
2. Navigate the project directory and install dependencies.
```
npm install
```
3. Enter the following command to start up dbHive. 
```
npm run dev
```
6. Create an account on the signup page.
7. Connect your database and get started!

## Features
### ‚ûÆ Extensive Metrics on Query Execution Times
Get a broad sense of database performance by viewing average query times across the database, as well as averages for specific types of queries (INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, DELETE). Slowest queries
### ‚ûÆ Query Impact
Track how many table rows are affected by a given query.
### ‚ûÆ Most Frequent Queries
Details here
### ‚ûÆ Other Key Stats
Conflicts, deadlocks, transactions committed, rolled back transations, cache hit ratio
### ‚ûÆ Access everything with a secure account
dbHive requires secure login before providing access to a user's database metrics.
### ‚ûÆ Connect one or more databases
With the ability to toggle between multiple database dashboards, dbHive allows users to easily access all their database information in one place.
### ‚ûÆ Customize database metrics dashboard
Use dropdowns to view more details on a given metric. Expand graphs to fill the screen. Adjust the frequency at which the dashboard is updated with the latest metrics.
### ‚ûÆ Delete a database
Remove a database when it is no longer in use, keeping your dashboard organized.

## Testing
To conduct tests on the codebase, **fork** and **clone** this [repository](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/dbhive) to your machine, and then execute the command:
```
npm run test
```

## Future Enhancements
- Search Feature: Add a search bar to the dashboard that allows users to find data by keywords.
- Expansion to Other Databases: Make dbHive available for other databases besides PostgreSQL.
- Comparing Schemas: Allow users to compare the performance of alternate database schemas alongside their current schemas.
- Additional Customization: Give users more power to customize graphs and dashboard arrangement.
